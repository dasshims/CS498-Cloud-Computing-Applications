# TODO
# Task: implement your topology for part d

# topology configuration
# this will be passed to the submitter as a map of config options
config:
    storm.local.hostname: "localhost"
    topology.max.task.parallelism: 3
    # set this to true if you want to see more debug log
    # set it to false before submitting

    # Hint: you can set input file path here
    # make sure it's "/tmp/data.txt" in your final submission

    # Hint: set N here
    # make sure it's 10 in your final submission

# spout definitions
spouts:

# bolt definitions
bolts:
  # Hint: the new top N tracking bolt you need implement in this part is
  # multilang/resources/top_n_finder_bolt.py
  # You need to load N from conf when initialize the bolt

  # Hint: change the store bolt to store the top-N words, for which you need to implement 
  # multilang/resources/top_n_store_bolt.py

# stream definitions
# stream definitions define connections between spouts and bolts.
streams:
  # Hint: add new top N finder bolt into the topology
